# @pixeldrive/peppol-toolkit

A TypeScript toolkit for preparing and reading documents for e-invoicing and PEPPOL integration. This library helps you generate PEPPOL-compliant UBL XML invoices from structured data.

PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line) is a set of specifications that enables cross-border e-procurement in Europe and beyond. This toolkit simplifies the process of creating compliant electronic invoices.

## Features

- üöÄ Generate PEPPOL-compliant UBL XML invoices
- üì¶ ESM and CommonJS builds for broad compatibility
- üî∑ Written in TypeScript with bundled type definitions
- üß™ Built with fast-xml-parser for reliable XML generation
- ‚ö° Simple API for quick integration

## Installation

```bash
npm install @pixeldrive/peppol-toolkit
```

## Quick Start

### ESM

```typescript
import { PeppolToolkit, createToolkit } from '@pixeldrive/peppol-toolkit';

// Using the class directly
const toolkit = new PeppolToolkit();

// Or using the factory function
// const toolkit = createToolkit();

// Generate PEPPOL UBL XML from invoice data
const invoiceData = {};
const peppolXML = toolkit.invoiceToPeppolUBL(invoiceData);
console.log(peppolXML);
```

### CommonJS

```javascript
const { PeppolToolkit, createToolkit } = require('@pixeldrive/peppol-toolkit');

const toolkit = new PeppolToolkit();
const peppolXML = toolkit.invoiceToPeppolUBL({});
```

## API Reference

### PeppolToolkit

The main class that provides invoice conversion functionality.

#### Methods

- `invoiceToPeppolUBL(invoice: Invoice): string`
    - Converts an invoice object to PEPPOL-compliant UBL XML
    - Returns: XML string formatted for PEPPOL compliance
